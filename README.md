# Bachelor thesis: The Effects of Monetary Policy on the Banking Industry.
In my undergraduate thesis, I explored the effects of interest rates on the banking sector, a topic that has been widely discussed in recent public debates. This research allowed me to delve into various statistical concepts, including Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), stationary and non-stationary time series, and cointegration. Additionally, the project enhanced my proficiency in R and Python, further advancing my technical skills. 

This repository contains the code used for writing the thesis, which is attached. Additionally, it includes the data used and the results produced.
